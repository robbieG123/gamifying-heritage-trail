The mill employed 500 people to spin and prepare the jute which was sent across the road to a seperate factory on Milne Street to be weaved. In 1889, Verdant Works stopped being a true textile manufacturer and in 1893 was bought by Alexander Thomson and Sons to recycle jute waste into flock for mattresses and furniture.
